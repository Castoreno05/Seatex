## User Story

```
AS A Quality Supervisor for an Oil & Gas company
I WANT an application that will display real-time data throughout processing units
SO THAT operations will have access to live updates from Quality Technicians
```

## Demo

Quality Technician navigates from the main page into "Check-in" page to document received chemical sample.
Live data displays throughout processing units from "Results" page.

[Sample Check-in.webm](https://github.com/Castoreno05/Seatex/assets/105801681/b7749dd6-b4a9-4fc9-8e58-7415cd7f4409)

Quality Technician navigates from main page into "Update Samples" page to update checked in sample by assigning
an "Approved", "Adjust", or "Failed" status.
